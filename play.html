    <h3>Act 1, Scene 2</h3>
    <h6>II. Paris. The KING's palace.</h6> 
        <p>Flourish of cornets KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING </h6>
        <p class="speech KING">The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
        Have fought with equal fortune and continue
        A braving war.</p>
        <h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>
        <p class="speech First-Lord">So 'tis reported, sir.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
        <p class="speech KING">Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
        A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
        With caution that the Florentine will move us
        For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
        Prejudicates the business and would seem
        To have us make denial.</p>
        <h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>
        <p class="speech First-Lord">His love and wisdom,
        Approved so to your majesty, may plead
        For amplest credence.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
        <p class="speech KING">He hath arm'd our answer,
        And Florence is denied before he comes:
        Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
        The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
        To stand on either part.</p>
        <h6 class="name">Second Lord</h6>
        <p class="speech Second-Lord">It well may serve
        A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
        For breathing and exploit.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
        <p class="speech KING">What's he comes here?</p>
        <h6 class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</h6>
        <h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>
        <p class="speech First-Lord">It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
        Young Bertram.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
        <p class="speech KING">Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
        Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
        Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
        Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</p>
        <h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>
        <p class="speech BERTRAM">My thanks and duty are your majesty's.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
        <p class="speech KING">I would I had that corporal soundness now,
        As when thy father and myself in friendship
        First tried our soldiership! He did look far
        Into the service of the time and was
        Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
        But on us both did haggish age steal on
        And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
        To talk of your good father. In his youth
        He had the wit which I can well observe
        To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
        Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
        Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
        So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
        Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
        His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
        Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
        Exception bid him speak, and at this time
        His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
        He used as creatures of another place
        And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
        Making them proud of his humility,
        In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
        Might be a copy to these younger times;
        Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
        But goers backward.</p>
        <h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>
        <p class="speech BERTRAM">His good remembrance, sir,
        Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
        So in approof lives not his epitaph
        As in your royal speech.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
        <p class="speech KING">Would I were with him! He would always say--
        Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
        He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
        To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
        This his good melancholy oft began,
        On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
        When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
        'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
        Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
        All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
        Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
        Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
        I after him do after him wish too,
        Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
        I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
        To give some labourers room.</p>
        <h6 class="name">Second Lord</h6>
        <p class="speech Second-Lord">You are loved, sir:
        They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
        <p class="speech KING">I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
        Since the physician at your father's died?
        He was much famed.</p>
        <h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>   
        <p class="speech BERTRAM">If he were living, I would try him yet.
        Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
        With several applications; nature and sickness
        Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
        My son's no dearer.</p>
