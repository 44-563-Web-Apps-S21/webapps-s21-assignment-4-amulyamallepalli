Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants
    <h4> KING</h4>
    The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
    Have fought with equal fortune and continue
    A braving war.
    <h4>First Lord</h4>
    So 'tis reported, sir.
    <h4>KING</h4>
    Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
    With caution that the Florentine will move us
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
    Prejudicates the business and would seem
    To have us make denial.
    <h4>First Lord</h4>
    His love and wisdom,
    Approved so to your majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.
    <h4>KING</h4>
    He hath arm'd our answer,
    And Florence is denied before he comes:
    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
    To stand on either part.
    <h4>Second Lord</h4>
    It well may serve
    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
    For breathing and exploit.
    <h4>KING</h4>
    What's he comes here?
    Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
    <h4>First Lord</h4>
    It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    <h4>KING</h4>
        Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
        Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
        Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
        Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
